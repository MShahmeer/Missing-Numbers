# Missing Numbers
Imagine you are given a list of slightly less than 1,000,000 numbers, all different, and each between 0 and 999,999 inclusive. How could you find (in a reasonable time) a number between 0 and 999,999 that is not on the list?
Unsuprisingly, binary search was marginally faster than linear in most cases.
